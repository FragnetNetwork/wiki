#What forms of payment does Fragnet accept?

At the moment, we are accepting most major credit cards through PayPal/Stripe as well as regular bank transfers.

Do have in mind that you can pay by Credit/Debit Card without registering a PayPal account at PayPal.

Payment Methods :

*   PayPal
*   Credit/Debit Card
*   Bank Transfer
*   Stripe
*   CoinPayments (cryptocurrencies)

  
Keep in mind that if you select "Bank Transfer" method, you MUST contact us via support ticket and send a proof of payment as our system can't detect bank transfers automatically.
