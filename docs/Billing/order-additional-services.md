# How do I order additional services?

It depends on the service you want to add to your account.
In most cases you can order a new service via the order from on our website: [https://fragnet.net/?page=gameservers](https://fragnet.net/?page=gameservers)

At the checkout, on the bottom there will be the order form, if you are an existing customer, you will be able to log into your account and therefore the service will be added to your existing client account. 
This will also mean you will have the service added to the same Game Panel account.

If you don't see a game server that you would like to have on our website, you can always reach out to us as we may be able to offer it for you!
