Before making any configuration file changes, you should always create a backup of it.  
To create a backup, follow the next steps:

# **Create a backup of myserverconfig.xml**

**Step 1:** Login to the [Fragify panel](https://panel.fragify.net/auth/login) and select your 7 Days to Die server. 

**Step 2:** Go to **File Manager**  

**Step 3:** Locate a file named **myserverconfig.xml**  

**Step 4:** Right-click on the file and press **Download**  

**Step 5:** Save the file somewhere easy to remember.

Now when you want to edit the config file go to **File Manager** and select **myserverconfig.xml**. This will open editor window and you can change values of variables to your preferences. Don't forget to click on **Save Content**.
Next to every command in the file there will be an explanation about the property you want to change.
