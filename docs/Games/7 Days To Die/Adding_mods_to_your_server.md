To begin with, you will need to follow the next steps to implement mods on your server.

**Step 1:** Go to game panel and select your service  
**Step 2:** You will find a section named **File Manager** and open it  
**Step 3:** Now there will be an option to create a folder that says **New Folder**, after clicking on it, you will be displayed an input prompt where you need to write name **Mods**  
**Step 4:** After you created a folder now you will need to navigate to one of the sites where you can download Mods, two of the most famous are [7daystodiemods](https://7daystodiemods.com/) and [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie).  
**Step 5:** Find a mod you want to enable on your server and download it to your PC. After the download is completed, be sure to save it somewhere where mod is easily reachable.  
**Step 6:** After you downloaded all the mods, extract them in separate folders.  
**Step 7:** You are almost done, now you just need to head back to game panel where you created Mods folder in Step 3 and upload folders there.  
**Step 8:** Restart your server, so your adjustments are in place and you are good to go!
