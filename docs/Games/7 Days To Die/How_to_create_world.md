# **Create a new world, but keep the old one**

**Step 1:** Log in to your account on our [Fragify panel](https://panel.fragify.net/auth/login) and find your 7 Days To Die server.  
**Step 2:** Navigate to **Configure** and find **Game World** variable. Set it to any world that you would like for the server to load. You can also switch **World Gen Size**, **World Seed**, and **Game Name**.

**Step 3:** Restart the server and new world will be generated. =)

>Keep in mind that RWG world can take longer time to generate depending on the value of **World Gen Size**. 
When setting the higher value, the server will start generating a large map size, which will take long to generate / download / load the map.
