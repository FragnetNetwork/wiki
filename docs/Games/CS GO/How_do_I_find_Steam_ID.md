There are few ways to find your STEAM ID

While connected on the server
=============================

To find your Steam ID, connect to a server and then in your console type "**status**".

Your Steam ID is displayed beside your nickname in the format STEAM\_X:X:XXXXXX.  
This does not work on LAN server or while Steam is offline.

Using 3rd party websites
========================

To find your Steam ID via 3rd party website (such as [steamidfinder.com](http://steamidfinder.com), [https://steamid.xyz/](https://steamid.xyz/)), you first need to go to your steam profile.  
You can do it by pressing this link: [http://steamcommunity.com/my/profile](http://steamcommunity.com/my/profile)

Once you click on that, you should be forwarded to your steam account. In the address bar it should look like this : [http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047834x](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047834700)xx.

Copy that link and paste it on one of the following websites. You should get your Steam ID now.
