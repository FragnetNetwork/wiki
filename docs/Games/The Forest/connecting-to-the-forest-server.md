# Connecting to your The Forest Server

Connecting via Server Browser
=============================

> GSLT Token needs to be set in the **Steam Account Token** variable, which can be found by navigating to the **Configure** option on the left-side menu. Create a token [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) with app ID: 242760.

Please, restart the server for the change to be applied.

  
Once you have added your GSLT token and restarted the server, your server should be accessible via the server browser. 

Follow these steps to connect to your server:

*   Launch your game via Steam.

*   Go to **Multiplayer** => **Join Game** => **Dedicated (Internet)** tab.

*   Press **Refresh**.

*   Find your server on the list or write the name of it in the "Filter by name" field.

Wait for the browser to query the server once it's queried. Simply press **Join**.
