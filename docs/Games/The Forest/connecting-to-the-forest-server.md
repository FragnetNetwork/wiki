#Connecting to your The Forest Server

Connecting via Server Browser
=============================

  
!!! info "INFO"
	GSLT Token needs to be set in server.cfg for this. Create a token [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) with app ID: 242760 and insert the token under "serverSteamAccount" in your server.cfg

  
Once you add your GSLT token in server.cfg, your server should be accessible via server browser. 

Simply follow these steps to connect to your server:

*   Launch your game via Steam
*   Go to Multiplayer → Dedicated (Internet)
*   Press refresh
*   Find your server on the list or simply write the name of it in the "Filter by name" field

Wait for the browser to query the server. Once it's queried, simply press "Join"

If you already have character on the server, you need to press "Continue" upon joining. If you press "Join" your character progress will be lost, and you will start from the beginning!
