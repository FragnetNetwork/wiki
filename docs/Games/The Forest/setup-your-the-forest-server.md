# How to setup your The Forest server

All server configurations are done on the Fragify panel in variables available in the **Configure** option and in your **server.cfg**, which can be accessed via **File Manager** in `TheForestDedicatedServer_Data/forest/config` directory.

Keep in mind that the server needs to be restarted after modifying server.cfg so the changes can take effect.

How to modify your server settings
==================================

*   Navigate to the **Configure** option on the left-side menu, and you will see all available configurations that can be changed on the server.

How to add your GSLT token
==========================

GSLT is required if you want to see your server on the server browser.  
To add GSLT to your server, do the following:

*   Navigate to the **Configure** option on the left-side menu.
*   Search for the **STEAM ACCOUNT TOKEN** variable and paste your token that can be generated on https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers using APP ID: **242760**.

2\. Restart the server for the changes to be applied.
