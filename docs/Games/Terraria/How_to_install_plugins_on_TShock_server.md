Adding plugins to your server is pretty straightforward. First, go to https://github.com/Pryaxis/plugins, choose the plugins you want, and download them.
1\. Once downloaded, navigate to your **File Manager** on your Fragify panel.

2\. Go to the `ServerPlugins` folder and upload the plugin there.
Files can be uploaded by dragging and dropping the file to the folder directory or using the **Upload** button.

3\. Once done, Start/Restart your server, and your plugins have been installed.
 
> Take note that almost all plugins won't work correctly after a big update and will require updating. And some plugins may not work correctly if other similar plugins impede their work.
