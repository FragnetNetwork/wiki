This article will describe the steps required for your singleplayer world to be loaded on the Terraria server.

1\. We will need to locate your world files (`.wld, .wld.bak`) that is stored in `C:Users/yourPCUsername/Documents/My Games/Terraria/Worlds`.

Click on **Upload** or use the drag and drop function for your world files (`.wld` and `.wld.bak`).
