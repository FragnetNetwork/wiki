1\. Make sure that your server is on the `tModLoader` template. You can check it in the **Templates** option on the left-side menu.

2\. Install tModLoader client from Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/

> More information about client-side installation can be found [here](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/tModLoader-guide-for-players).

3\. Once installed tModLoader, you can go to **Workshop** => **Download Mods** option in the menu to see a list of mods that can be installed. Install mods that you would like to play with.

All mods should be set to **Enabled** status, as shown in the screenshot above. 

5\. Navigate to **Open Mods Folder** option on the bottom. The new explorer window will open with the `enabled.json` file and window with a list of tModLoader mods from Steam Workshop.

7\. We will need to get the `enabled.json` file from one of the opened folders on the path: `C:\Users\yourPCUsername\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\Mods` and upload it `mods` folder on the server by clicking on the **Upload** button or using the drag and drop function. The same should be done for another folder that was opened with tModLoader mods.

> As shown in the gif above, all mods will be in their folders. You will need to open each folder and upload the `.tmod` file to the `mods` folder. You will need to select the latest versions of mods if you have downloaded several versions. The folder format of mods goes like this: `[year].[highest number]`. The latest version would be like `2022.8`

8\. Restart the server, and all mods should be enabled on your server.
