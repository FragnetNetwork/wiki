1\. We recommend making a backup of your world files that can be accessed via **File Manager**. The default location: `saves/Worlds`.

The easiest way to make a backup is to tick the box close to `/home/container/saves/Worlds` which will select all files in this directory. Click on **Archive** button at the right-bottom corner. Afterwards, the new archive will be generated and you will need to click on **...** => **Download** option in the menu.

You can also use **Backups** function which can be found on the left-side menu. Click on **Create a Backup** button and input **Backup Name**. Afterwards, click on **Start Backup** button and your server files will be saved in remote backup.
