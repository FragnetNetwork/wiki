4\. Once done, go to your worlds location on your PC. The default location is `C:\Users%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds`. After you have found your world, it will have a very long name, change it to anything you want.

5\. All you need to do now is upload the file to your server, but first stop your Terraria server on Fragify panel.

6\. Go to your **File Manager** and drag and drop your world file or use **Upload** button in `saves/Worlds` directory.
