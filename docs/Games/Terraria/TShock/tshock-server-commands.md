#TShock Server Commands

Here's a full list of the TShock commands available after you install TShock (can be done via your Mod Manager in the control-panel):

All these can either be issued from in-game when you've authorized your account as SuperAdmin, or via the control-panel web console. If you use the web console, you should not put a "/"-sign before the command.
