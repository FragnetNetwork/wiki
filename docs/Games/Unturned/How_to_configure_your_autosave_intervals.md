2. Now find the command ```<AutomaticSave Enabled="true" Interval="1800" /> ```. It should be on the 4th line.

3. You can choose the interval of the autosaves. At the moment itâ€™s 1800 seconds. So every hour, the server creates an autosave. You can change it to any time interval you want and then click on **Save Content**.
