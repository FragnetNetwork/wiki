Uploading your singleplayer savegame is fairly simple.

1. Firstly, you need to locate your Unturned installation on your PC. The default is `\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Unturned\Worlds\Singleplayer_0`. Zip or Rar all of the files, and we're ready to upload.

2. **Don’t forget to stop your server**. Once the files have been zipped, navigate to your **File Manager** on your Fragify game panel and go to `Servers => Default`. Delete the following: 
```
Config.json
Level folder
Players folder
```

3. Upload your zip by either drag and drop it to the files window in the **File Manager** or you can click on the **Upload** button on your upper right corner of the screen and select the zip you have made. 

4. Afterwards, click on the 3 dots on the zip file and on **Unarchive** option, which will unzip all the files.

Start your server, connect to it and now you’re playing your Singleplayer world on your server.
