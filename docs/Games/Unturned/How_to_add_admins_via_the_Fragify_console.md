Adding admins via our Fragify console is very simple.

Make the player you want to make admin join the server 

![Player](../images/player.png)

After the player has connected, you can use the PlayerID or Name as shown in the screenshot.

The command is: ` Admin playername`

![Admin Command](../images/admin-command.png)

After pressing **Enter/Return**, you will see the console saying **Successfully admined and the PlayerID**.
