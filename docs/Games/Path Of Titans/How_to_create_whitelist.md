If you have a private server and only want specific players to join, you can create a Whitelist by following steps described below.

**Step 1:** Login to your account on [Fragify panel](https://panel.fragify.net/) and select your Path of Titans server.

**Step 2:** Make sure that the server is stopped. Afterwards, go to **File Manager** on the left-side menu and navigate to `PathOfTitans/Saved` directory. There you will find **whitelist.txt** and you will need to click on it for editing.
## Formatting:
Add the Alderon Games ID (AGID) of each whitelisted user on a new line.

## Example whitelist.txt
```
525-053-709
525-123-709
123-456-789
```
**Step 3:** Click on **"Save Content"** button and start/restart the server for the changes to be applied.
