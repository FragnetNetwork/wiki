When the server has been added to the server manager, you can choose your starting area in the **Create Game** tab.

After the session creation, the starting area can be changed by moving your HUB to that designated area.

Or by resetting your progress, starting the session again and choosing the wanted starting area.

The four starting areas are:

**Grass Fields**

*Ideal for first-time pioneers*

> The first viable building location FICSIT had found, standing out because of its open and relatively flat fields. Considering the distances between mining locations, building outposts and/or large transportation lines may be necessary eventually.

**Rocky Desert**

*Suitable for first-time pioneers*

> The textbook example of a FICSIT-approved building location, with balanced resources, space, and distances. Additionally, it is very close to the sea, making water an easy commodity.

**Northern Forest**

*Good for more experienced pioneers*

> A lush building location with many height differences and a few open areas, challenging conventional building and planning methods. Despite these challenges, it caught our eye due to the richness of its resources.

**Dune Desert**

*Recommended for advanced pioneers*

> Initially considered too risky, further investigation has convinced us that this area is viable for building with its large, open spaces and plentiful mining locations. Foliage and water locations are rare and contained, making initial power set-ups challenging.
