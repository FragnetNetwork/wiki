Due to Satisfactory being early access, the developers are still ironing all the kinks of the game,

Staying on the main menu while your **Server Manager** is selected will have a chance to give you a `"This server appears to be offline"` even though the server is running on your game panel. 

To make the server “online” in your game all that has to be done is to restart your game and the server will appear as running again.
