Firstly weâ€™ll need to delete the server files for new ones to be created for the experimental version.

**WARNING: This will delete all of your sessions**

1. Stop your server and navigate to your **File Manage** on the game panel then go to `config => Epic => FactoryGame => Saved => SaveGames => server`

    If you wish to have a backup, simply go back one directory, tick the box near the server folder, navigate to the **...** alongside the bar, a small menu will appear and click on **Archive** as illustrated in the screenshot here.

2. Once ready, delete the contents of the **server** folder.

3. Go to your Fragify game panel and navigate to **Settings**.

4. Scroll down and find **[Advanced] Branch Name**.

5. Click on the small arrow pointing down and two options will appear and one of them being **experimental**. Choose that option and start your server.

6. Done! Your server is now running on experimental mode.
