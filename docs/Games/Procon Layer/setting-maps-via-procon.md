#Setting up Maplist via Procon

You can configure the maplist for your Battlefield server via Procon, in a rather easy way.

While connected to your server with Procon client, simply navigate to "**Lists**" â†’ "**Maplist**"

On the left side you will see all the maps in their respected game modes, and on the right is your current maplist.  
Simply select the map that you wish to add, adjust how many rounds and add it to your list.
