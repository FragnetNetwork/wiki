1. To edit the PvP setting for your server head over to `DoNotStarveTogether => config => server => cluster.ini`.

2. Open up the cluster.ini file and under the [GAMEPLAY] section edit the pvp command:
```
pvp = true
```
It should look something like this:
![pvp](../images/pvp.png)

In this instance I have enabled the PvP, if you want to disable it type in `false` instead of `true`. 

3. Once done click on **Save Content**.

4. Start/Restart your server and youâ€™re done. The change has been applied to the server.
