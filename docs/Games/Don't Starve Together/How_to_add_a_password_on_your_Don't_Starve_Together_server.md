To make your server password protected, all that needs to be done is edit the **cluster.ini** file.

1. Head over to your File Manager on your Fragify game panel and then go to `DoNotStarveTogether => config => server => cluster.ini`.

2. Open up the **cluster.ini** file and go to the [NETWORK] section and find:
```
cluster_password = 
```
3. Type in a password. It should look something like this:
![](../images/cluster-password.png)
4. Once added, click on **Save Content** located in the lower right corner. 
![Save Contnet](../images/save-content.png)

5. Start/Restart your server.

That's it! You've now password protected your server.
