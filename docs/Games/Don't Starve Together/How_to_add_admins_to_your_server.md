Adding admins to your Don’t Starve Together server requires creating an **adminlist.txt** file at a specific location.

1. Open up your **File Manager** on your game panel. 

2. Go to this directory: `DoNotStarveTogether => config => server`.

3. Once there, click on **New File** located in the upper right corner of the panel.

5.  It will prompt you to name the file. It’s very important to name it **adminlist.txt**.

6. Afterwards, click on Create File and Start/Restart you server and connect to it.

If successfully done, you should see a star icon near your character portrait: ![Character portrait](../images/character-portrait.png)
