1. Firstly youâ€™ll need sourcemod installed, do check out our guide on how to install it [here](How_to_install_metamod_and_sourcemod_on_your_TF2_server.md) if you need help.

2. If you have sourcemod installed, go to these sites to download the plugin you want:

3. Once you have chosen and downloaded the wanted plugin, navigate to your **File Manager**.
![File Manager](../images/file-manager.png)
Go to **tf => addons => sourcemod => plugins**.
Then upload the plugin in that directory by clicking on upload or drag and drop the file
![Upload](../images/upload.png)
Once it has been uploaded **Start/Restart** your server and it has been installed.

*If the mod has any other instructions on setting it up, please read through the instructions as every mod is unique, and some do require additional setups.*
