### First, we need to get the IP of the server. Go to your Fragify game panel. 
### There are two ways to connect to your server :
# Via Steam
1. Connect via **Steam Favorites**.
Please navigate to the **Server Information panel** and double-click your IP, which will copy it.

# Via In-game Console
You will need to enable developer console for this method. To find out how to enable it, you can check our article about it [here](How_to_enable_developer_console.md). 
1. Get in your game. If you have your developer console enabled, press the **Tilde ( ` )** button.
