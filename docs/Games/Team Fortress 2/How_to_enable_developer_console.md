Turn on your game and go to **Options**.

The **Keyboard** tab should be open by default which is what we need, and then click on **Advanced…**.

A small window will pop up. Tick the box adjacent to **Enable developer console**, and that’s it. You’ve now enabled the developer console and can turn it on by pressing the **Tilde ( ` )** button.
