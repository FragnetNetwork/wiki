#How to load custom map on your RUST Server

It is possible to have a custom map on the RUST Server apart from the original ones and it's rather easy to load one. Just follow these simple steps:

1.  Upload your custom .map file to Dropbox
2.  Once uploaded, copy the download link
3.  Go to your RUST service on the Fragnet Game Panel
4.  Navigate to Commandline Manager â‡¾ Custom commandline
5.  Edit your existing Custom commandline or create a new one
6.  Under the +levelurl parameter paste your download link  
    Example: https://www.dropbox.com/s/<randomcharacters>/<mapname>.map?dl=0
7.  Change the dl=0 to dl=1 in that link  
    Example: https://www.dropbox.com/s/<randomcharacters>/<mapname>.map?dl=1
8.  Once done, tick the checkbox before the +levelurl parameter and press Save.
9.  Restart the server so the changes can take effect.

You have now successfully added a custom map to your RUST server!
