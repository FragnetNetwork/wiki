# How to change your server name

Just like the other parameters that are adjusted via variables in **Configure** option for Rust, server name option is not an exception.

To change your RUST server name simply follow these steps:

*   Login to the [Fragify panel](https://panel.fragify.net/auth/login) and select your Rust server.

*   Navigate to **Configure** option on the left-side menu.
