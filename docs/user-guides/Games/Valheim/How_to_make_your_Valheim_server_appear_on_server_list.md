Surely you have noticed that Valheim has an in-game server browser where Community servers are listed.  
This can be easily enabled by following the next steps.  

1.  On the game-panel navigate to “Commandline Manager” → “Custom Commandlines” and create a new one.
    
2.  Make sure to tick the checkbox and set the value to 1 under the “Public” option

3.  Save the commandline and restart your server.
    

> **_NOTE:_**  Keep in mind that Valheim has some limitation with the in-game server browser, so even the servers that could appear on the list may not, due to there being too many servers to show.

Because of this, we don’t recommend connecting to your server via the server listings, as this is an unreliable way of finding your server.
