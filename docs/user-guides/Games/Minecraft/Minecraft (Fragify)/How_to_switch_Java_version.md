There are 2 available Java options to choose that will run your server.

*   Java 8
    
*   Java 11
    

Depending on which version suits you more, setting the server to load a specific version is rather easy.  
Simply follow these steps:

*   Stop your server on the Fragify panel
    
*   Navigate to “Startup” tab
    
*   Locate the “Docker image” option and select the version you would like to use from the dropdown menu
