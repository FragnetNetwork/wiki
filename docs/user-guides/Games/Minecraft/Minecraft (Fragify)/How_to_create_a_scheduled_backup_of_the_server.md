Scheduled tasks on Fragify panel are based on Linux’s [crontab](https://crontab.cronhub.io/).  
They are rather easy to setup once you get the hang of it.  

On you Fragify Panel navigate to “Schedules” and press “Create schedule”.  
You will need to configure when and how often your task will be processed.

For example if you want the task to be performed every day at 1 am you will set it like this:

Once the schedule is created, we need to add a task to it. Simply click on that freshly created schedule and press “New task”

Select which task you want to run under the “Actions” menu and you are good to go!
