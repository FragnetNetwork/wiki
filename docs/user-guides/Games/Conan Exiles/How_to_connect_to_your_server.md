### Why doesn't my server show up on the in-game server browser?

There have been a lot of reports of issues with the in-game server browser. If you can't find your server, first update it by running "Steam Update" on the control panel. If you still don't find it check "Show Invalid Servers" on the in-game server browser and click refresh.
