#Installing Rust:IO on your RUST server

Rust:IO is a Rust Oxide extension, which adds a fully interactive browser live map of your Rust world. This map allows you to see player locations, buildings, and more. 

> **_NOTE:_** Server should be stopped before installing Rust:IO!

Adding Rust:IO to your server:

*   Go to your RUST service on the Fragnet Game Panel
*   Navigate to Mod Manager
*   Make sure that **uMod/OxideMod** is installed, if not simply press install as this is a requirement for Rust:IO
*   Install **Rust:IO Latest** 
*   Once installed, simply start the server and this extension will load

You have successfully installed Rust:IO to your server. You can now find your server on [playrust:io](http://playrust.io/) [](http://playrust.io/)when you write your server name!
