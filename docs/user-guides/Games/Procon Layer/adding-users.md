#Adding users

You can easily add another user and give him access to the Procon Layer and the server.

Once you are connected to the Procon Layer, simply navigate to the "**Parental Layer Control**" → "**Accounts**"

You will already see your account and on the bottom you will have an option to create a new account.

Write the username and password for the new account and press the button "**Create account**"

Once a new account has been created, it will appear on the list.

Do have in mind that the newly created account does **NOT** have any kind of access or privileges by default.
