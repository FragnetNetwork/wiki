# Updating your server

## Using Steamcmd
Once there is a new update available, you can always use the **Steam Update** button to get the latest files.

### Backups
When you initiate a steam update on your server, we take a backup of both **ServerHostSettings.json** and **ServerGameSettings.json** otherwise steamcmd will overwrite them.
The current auto save settings also allow you to set save interval and save count in case the data persistance gets corrupted after a restart or an update.
