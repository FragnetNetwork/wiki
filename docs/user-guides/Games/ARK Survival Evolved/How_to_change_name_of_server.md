To change the name of your server, follow the next steps.

**Step 1:** Go to game panel and find your service.  
**Step 2:** You will see on the left side several sections you are looking for **Configuration Files**  
**Step 3:** When you press on Configuration Files, you will see a list of several configuration files of your server. You should now see a file named **GameUserSettings.ini**. Press the **Config Editor** in order to edit it.  
**Step 4:** There are a lot of things you could change, but you are interested in changing the name of the server, so you need to find a line that says **Session Name** and right next to it should be an input label where you can write the name of your server.  
**Step 5:** After you changed it, simply press **Save & Exit** button in the top left corner of the box.

The server name has been successfully changed now. In order for these changes to be reflected, simply restart your server.
