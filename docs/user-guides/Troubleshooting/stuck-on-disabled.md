# Server stuck on Processing/Disabled

Should your server get stuck in a "Processing" or "Disabled" status after reinstalling your server or after installation of a mod/plugin using our Game Panel, you have to contact our [Support Department](https://clients.fragnet.net/submitticket.php).


This most likely happens because the server process is still looking up files, causing the installation to fail and therefore not returning it to it's running state.
To avoid this, make sure not to issue a new installation or reinstallation before you have received a confirmation via email about installation success.
