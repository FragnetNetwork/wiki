The integrated file manager is a lightweight solution for simple tasks such as file and folder deletions/renames, light file uploads. FTP is more suited for heavier tasks such as large file uploads (both in size and number), moving files from one directory to another and such. While we provide full access over server files for majority games that we are hosting, there are some games that are either limited or completely inaccessible via FTP or File Manager as per developer demands. Connecting to your FTP Account You can follow these steps to access and manage your server files using FTP : Download and install an FTP client, FileZilla is one of the most popular and feature-rich ones: Download FileZilla Connect to your FTP account using the following details: - Host : Your game server address Warning : Do not include the port after the IP address (I.E 192.168.1.1 instead of 192.168.1.1:25565) - Username : Your game panel username - Password : Your game panel password - Port : 8821 Use those credentials to fill in the field in your FTP client then click on \"quick connect\" Be careful when you type this information as you may get a 5 minutes ban if you attempt to login with the wrong credentials repeatedly. In that situation, simply disconnect and wait 5 minutes before trying again Uploading and downloading files or folders FTP is particularly useful for backing up your server files, or uploading plugins/worlds/settings onto your server.

After installing/uninstalling several mods on your server, there could be a potential issue where the server won\u2019t start if you previously had some mod and then uninstalled it.

(Note however, that some game modes will not work properly if there are more players on the server than the game mode is designed for.) Upon startup, the MapList.txt file is read. During runtime, the mapList.* commands can be used to edit the set of maps. When the same map is played for several rounds, all 2-team game modes stipulate that the teams will switch sides after a run. This way, a 2-round session of Rush will have players play both attackers and defenders. Controlling map switching (via console) mapList.* can be used to edit the map list while the server is running. mapList.setNextMapIndex sets which will be the next map. mapList.getMapIndices returns information on which is the current and next map in the list. mapList.runNextRound switches to the next round, without finishing the current. mapList.restartRound makes all players reload the current map, and restarts the current round. mapList.endRound declares a specific team as the winning team, and then moves directly to the end-of-round screen.

GOTV allows you to watch a game currently in progress with some perks which you wouldn't usually have on the server as spectator. Enabling GOTV There are 2 ways to enable GOTV on Fragnet servers: Enable it via control panel by going to configuration files and editing server.cfg with \"Configuration editor\" Manually adding the following commands to server.cfg: tv_enable \"1\" //Enables GOTV tv_autorecord \"0\" //1 automatically records tv_maxclients \"10\" //Defines the number of concurrent connections to your GOTV tv_delay \"90\" //Specifies the delay for the GOTV stream tv_advertise_watchable 1 After making any kind of changes to server.cfg, you should restart your server so those changes can apply. GOTV will have the same IP address as the server, but the port number will be different. To connect to GOTV, you need the IP address and port for the GOTV server. For Fragnet servers GOTV port usually goes +1 on the first digit from the server port. For example: Server IP is : x.x.x.x:27015, GOTV will be x.x.x.x:37015 GOTV status You can check if your GOTV is working by simply writing the following command in your console (while you are on the server): rcon status. If everything is setuped correctly you'll have the following output Demos If not setuped to automatically record, you can manually start and stop recording your matches on the server by typing the following commands: tv_record nameoftherecording - Starts GOTV demo recording with the name you specified tv_stoprecord - Stops GOTV demo recording with the name you specified If you have any GOTV recordings, you will find them in /csgo/ folder when you access it via File manager (on Game panel) or FTP Client.

The process for running mods outside single player is very crude and manual right now. The developers will make the process simpler in the future and hopefully add support for automatic download of mods when you join a server. Installing Mods on your client The fastest and easiest way to get the mod information is to subscribe to them on Steam. This will cause the client to begin downloading and installing the selected mods automatically to the single player installation on your local computer. This has the side effect of getting all the mods set up on your client anyway, which you will need to connect to the server later on. Once it's done downloading them, you need to find where the file are stored on your computer. They will most frequently be found at /ProgramFiles(x86)/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/440900 unless you installed your steam somewhere else. 440900 is the ID number for the game Conan Exiles on Steam. Each folder inside will be the workshop ID number of a mod downloaded from the steam workshop. Inside those folders you will find the actual mod files, all ending in .pak ; those are the files you will need to copy, the numbered folders are not needed, just the files inside the folder. Create a \u201cMods\u201d folder on the server In the /ConanSandbox directory of your Conan Exiles server, create a folder titled Mods . Upload the mods to your server Once you have all the .pak files, we recommend \"zipping\" the files using any of the tools that provide such option (7zip, WinRAR etc.), and upload them to the /Mods folder on your server. Once they're uploaded to the /Mods folder, unzip the zip file you created. You can use drag and drop in the file manager tab of your control panel, or FTP software. For any larger zips files, we recommend using FTP, as uploads can be resumable in-case of any network problems. Otherwise, you can upload the mod files one by one. Creating modlist.txt config file To actually enable the mods on your server, you need to edit a text file which will contain the file names of each mod that needs to be loaded on the server. The contents of the file should look like this, where each mod needs to have an asterisk in front of it and each mod should be in a separate line, like *ModName1.pak *ModName2.pak Once you have completed everything, restart your server.

As such, the only folder we provide access to via FTP is the /Mods folder in case clients want to upload custom mods. If your folder is completely empty when you connect via FTP, that's because you don't have any installed mods. When they are installed via control panel, they will show up. Otherwise, you can just upload your mods to the empty folder, and they will show up on the control panel. Connecting to your FTP Account You can follow these steps to access and manage your server files using FTP : Download and install an FTP client, FileZilla is one of the most popular and feature-rich ones: Download FileZilla Connect to your FTP account using the following details: - Host : Your game server address Warning : Do not include the port after the IP address (I.E 192.168.1.1 instead of 192.168.1.1:25565) - Username : Your game panel username - Password : Your game panel password - Port : 8821 Use those credentials to fill in the field in your FTP client then click on \"quick connect\" Be careful when you type this information as you may get a 5 minutes ban if you attempt to login with the wrong credentials repeatedly. In that situation, simply disconnect and wait 5 minutes before trying again Uploading and downloading files or folders FTP is particularly useful for backing up your server files, or uploading plugins/worlds/settings onto your server.

This can be done via your control-panel, simply navigate to your Terraria Game Panel and open the \" Mod Manager \". Once opened install the \"tModLoader\" mod which you can find there. Installing Mods You now have the modding platform tModLoader installed on your server, that means we can start installing Terraria mods. These can be found and downloaded at different locations across the internet, but most common is the Terraria official forums . Find the mods you want to have on your server and download them to your local PC. Now that you have the mods on your PC, you will need to upload them to your server. There are two ways to do this, either via FTP connection or via the file-manager in your control-panel. For the sake of simplicity, we'll go with the file-manager as it requires no third party programs (granted, you can use the Windows file explorer for FTP as well). Open your game panel again, and find \" File Manager \", open it up and you'll see a \" Mods \" folder (this will only show up if you have installed tModLoader as explained earlier in this post). Click on the aforementioned \" Mods \" folder and click the \" Upload \" button, go ahead and click \" Select Files \" to find the mod-files you downloaded earlier, they will have the extension \"tmod\". Once selected, click \"Upload\" and the files will be automatically uploaded to your \" Mods \" folder. When the files are in the correct folder, go back into your game panel and find \" Configuration files \", click it and you'll find a file called \"Mods\\enabled.json\" in the bottom. Edit this by clicking on the \"Text editor\" button. It will look like this: [ \"Mod1\", \"Mod2\" ] What this file does is enable your mods, they will not be automatically enabled after uploading them, so you'll have to enable them yourselves by typing in their names. For example, let's say I've uploaded the Tremor mod and the Calamity mod to my server, I would need to update the file to say: [ \"Tremor\", \"Calamity\" ] If I only uploaded the Tremor mod, It would look like this (notice that I removed the comma-sign after the first mod, as this is only to be used when there are more than one mod): [ \"Tremor\" ] If you have more than two mods, you will need to add commas after each one that is followed by another, in other words no comma on the last mod you load. When you've edited the file, save it and start your server up, the mods should now be loading correctly.
