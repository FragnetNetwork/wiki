As IP addresses are allocated to each of our machines, we are not able to transfer a single IP to another machine. We recommend setting up a subdomain for your service if possible, which can then be changed at any time to point to a different address if needed.</p> <p>Data Files: When a server is transferred, the files will be kept intact. While we always urge our customers to keep frequent backups of their services, the files themselves will not change when moved between machines.</p> <p>Duration: A server's transfer time primarly depends on the size of your servers files. Generally, waiting time for a server transfer is between 30 and 45 minutes, although this can often be faster or slower than that.
