As IP addresses are allocated to each of our machines, we are not able to transfer a single IP to another machine. We recommend setting up a subdomain for your service if possible, which can then be changed at any time to point to a different address if needed.

Duration : A server's transfer time primarly depends on the size of your servers files.

During runtime, the mapList.* commands can be used to edit the set of maps.

The current desired max number of players is the minimum of the max-cap and the vars.maxPlayers value. Normally the engine will accept runtime changes to the setting within a second. However, if the vars.maxPlayers setting is set to anything lower than the current number of players on the server, the effective max number of players on the server will remain unchanged. The server will then retry changing the effective max-cap every 10 seconds until it succeeds.","title":"How many players does a server support?"},{"location":"user-guides/Games/Battlefield%204/warm-up-and-pre-round/","text":"When a server first starts up, there are no players on it and the server is in warm-up state. Warm-up is a state where players can move around, complete objectives and so on, but scoring is disabled. Once the required number of players is reached, the game will reset the level and transition into pre-round. In pre-round, a timer counts down to the round start; players cannot move, shoot or take objectives during pre-round. When the timer has run out, the actual round begins. Players can move freely, take objectives and scoring is enabled during the round. If the number of players drops beneath the minimum threshold during the round, the round will be aborted and the server switches back to warm-up. You can change the number of players required to go between warm-up and in-round using vars.roundStartPlayerCount and vars.roundRestartPlayerCount in the startup.txt. The start player count must be higher than the restart player count \u2013 so if you set the starting player count below the restart player count, the engine will silently assume that the restart player count is one lower than the start player count.","title":"Warm up and pre round"},{"location":"user-guides/Games/CS%20GO/CSGO_GOTV/","text":"GOTV can be enabled on every CS:GO server. GOTV allows you to watch a game currently in progress with some perks which you wouldn't usually have on the server as spectator. Enabling GOTV There are 2 ways to enable GOTV on Fragnet servers: Enable it via control panel by going to configuration files and editing server.cfg with \"Configuration editor\" Manually adding the following commands to server.cfg: tv_enable \"1\" //Enables GOTV tv_autorecord \"0\" //1 automatically records tv_maxclients \"10\" //Defines the number of concurrent connections to your GOTV tv_delay \"90\" //Specifies the delay for the GOTV stream tv_advertise_watchable 1 After making any kind of changes to server.cfg, you should restart your server so those changes can apply. GOTV will have the same IP address as the server, but the port number will be different. To connect to GOTV, you need the IP address and port for the GOTV server. For Fragnet servers GOTV port usually goes +1 on the first digit from the server port. For example: Server IP is : x.x.x.x:27015, GOTV will be x.x.x.x:37015 GOTV status You can check if your GOTV is working by simply writing the following command in your console (while you are on the server): rcon status. If everything is setuped correctly you'll have the following output Demos If not setuped to automatically record, you can manually start and stop recording your matches on the server by typing the following commands: tv_record nameoftherecording - Starts GOTV demo recording with the name you specified tv_stoprecord - Stops GOTV demo recording with the name you specified If you have any GOTV recordings, you will find them in /csgo/ folder when you access it via File manager (on Game panel) or FTP Client.

The process for running mods outside single player is very crude and manual right now.

Installing Mods on your client The fastest and easiest way to get the mod information is to subscribe to them on Steam. This will cause the client to begin downloading and installing the selected mods automatically to the single player installation on your local computer. This has the side effect of getting all the mods set up on your client anyway, which you will need to connect to the server later on. Once it's done downloading them, you need to find where the file are stored on your computer. They will most frequently be found at /ProgramFiles(x86)/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/440900 unless you installed your steam somewhere else. 440900 is the ID number for the game Conan Exiles on Steam. Each folder inside will be the workshop ID number of a mod downloaded from the steam workshop. Inside those folders you will find the actual mod files, all ending in .pak ; those are the files you will need to copy, the numbered folders are not needed, just the files inside the folder. Create a \u201cMods\u201d folder on the server In the /ConanSandbox directory of your Conan Exiles server, create a folder titled Mods . Upload the mods to your server Once you have all the .pak files, we recommend \"zipping\" the files using any of the tools that provide such option (7zip, WinRAR etc.), and upload them to the /Mods folder on your server. Once they're uploaded to the /Mods folder, unzip the zip file you created. You can use drag and drop in the file manager tab of your control panel, or FTP software. For any larger zips files, we recommend using FTP, as uploads can be resumable in-case of any network problems. Otherwise, you can upload the mod files one by one. Creating modlist.txt config file To actually enable the mods on your server, you need to edit a text file which will contain the file names of each mod that needs to be loaded on the server. The contents of the file should look like this, where each mod needs to have an asterisk in front of it and each mod should be in a separate line, like *ModName1.pak *ModName2.pak Once you have completed everything, restart your server.
